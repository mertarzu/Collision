# Unity 3D Circle-Circle Collision Project

## Overview
This Unity project is focused on demonstrating basic circle-to-circle collision in a 3D environment which I developed as a three-day project in December 2022.  It features two spheres that change color based on collision detection, user input for moving one of the spheres, and a UI element to display the penetration depth during collisions.
